Welcome to WF-Resource Module

Firstly, many thanks for downloading WF-Resource and evaluating this module. We hope that you enjoy using it as much as we did developing it.

While WF-Resource has been written with quality and security in mind, we however cannot guarantee that it will be bug free or work as expected.
If in the case you find a problem, bug or security issue, please contact us at xoosla.com and submit a bug report.

What is WF-Resource?
This module is the resource module to all or if not most Xoosla Modules (WF-Projects). This module has been written to be as unobtrusive as much as possible and totally invisible once installed.

The idea is basically install and forget, until you are required to update. Then it will just be a case of deleting the old version and copy over the new version and performing an update.

Many thanks,

The Xoosla Team
